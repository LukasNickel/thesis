\subsection{DISP and SIGN}
\label{energy}

The performance of the models trained with the previously mentioned setup,
can be gauged looking at 
figure \ref{fig:disp_perf}. For the DISP regressor model,
the R$^2$ score is chosen as a measure for performance. 
In the case of the SIGN classification model, it is the accuracy.
Both models perform better for higher event energies with accuracy and
R$^2$ reaching values close to 1.
Identifying the telescope types illustrates the different energy ranges,
that they are sensitive to in terms of the R$^2$-score. Regarding the accuracy
of the SIGN prediction higher energies are favorable for all telescopes.

    \caption{Performance of the DISP and SIGN model on the pointlike test data. 
    In general both models performances improve with increasing energies.
    The R$^2$-score for the individual telescopes shows the different energy ranges 
    the telescope types are sensitive in. Because of the properties of the 
    R$^2$-score the individual curves do not add up to the total curve.
    The SIGN accuracy behaves more similar for all telescope types.}
    % At low energies signs of overfitting can be noticed.}

The feature importances are illustrated in the figures \ref{fig:disp_features}
for the DISP and \ref{fig:sign_features} for the SIGN model.
For the DISP model the stereoscopic features provide the most information.
Besides that, the light content, concentration and the length of the ellipse
are of most importance. Some separation into the different telescope types
seems to happen as well.
In the case of the SIGN model on the other hand, the predictions are almost
entirely based on the $skewness$ and $slope$ of the image.
The stereoscopic features do not provide much information in this case.
% which is expected as the head-/tail-ambiguation is entirely an artefact produced
% in the camera frame.

	    The stereoscopic features have high influence on the prediction.
    	From the monoscopic features, the features describing the light content and the
        shape of the ellipse, provide most information.
        Additionaly the $concentration$-features, the $area$, $width$ and $length$
        are of high importance to the model.}

            and $slope$. Other features provide very little information.}
