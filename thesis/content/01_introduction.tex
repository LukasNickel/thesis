\chapter{Introduction}

A big field in astro physics ever since Victor Hess discovered
the extraterrestrial origin of the atmosperic ionization (citation needed)
is astro particle physics. Despite falling out of favor for a few years
when terrestrial particle accelerators reached high (???) energies,
the field is very famous today. One of the reasons being that
even the best accelerators, like the LHC, got to a point where
increasing collision energies gets ever more difficult (citation needed).
Despite all the effort and numerous achievements (beispiele und belege!),
there are still many unanswered questions concerning modern
astrophysics. Some of the more prominent include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{General relativity (-> gravitational waves)}
    \item{Dark matter (-> gravitation being weird)}
    \item{Dark energy (expansion of the universe)}
    \item{Sources of VHE cosmic rays (acceleration processes involved)}
    \item{neutrinos (basically everything, majorana?)}
\end{itemize}

Nowadays there exists a wide range of experiments trying to
solve these questions. These focus on different ways to detect
extraterestrial particle sources which is why the
the term Multi Messenger Astronomy is widely used.


\section{The origins of astroparticle physics}
- coulomb, 1785: electroscopes discharge spontaneously
- crookes, 1879: dependency with air pressure -> ionisation of the air, but why?
- becquerel, 1896: spontaneous radioactivity
- curie, ??: radioactive decay with charged particles
- wilson, elster, geitel, ~1900: particles from outside the chamber, surroudnings, no signs of thembeing extraterrestrial
- 1909: penetrating metal -> $\gamma$-rays?, either usn, earth crust or atmosphere? expected most from the crust -> decrease wit height???
- wulff, 1909: eifel tower/300m -> decrease not as strong as expected
- pacini, 1910, underwater: a lot must be not from earth
- gockel, 1909: balloon -> same interpretation, still doubts in the community
- hess, 1911-1921: 7 ballons -> increase at some height -> not from earth and probaly extraterrestrial because same at night
- kollhörster, ??? : confirmation
-> hess: "höhenstrahlung", milikan: cosmic rays

- clay, 1927: dependent from magnetic field -> charged particles
- alvarez+compton/rossi/johnson -> more form west than east -> positive charge
- anderson 1933: cosmic rays i cloud chamber -> antimatter discovery
- rossi 1934/auger, 1937: coincident event in geiger müller at large distances -> particle showers -> high energy primary interacts in atmosphere

- more particels got found -> pions, muons
- cern, 1954 -> do we even need astro anymore? fermi: we can get up to 5000TeV in theory -> lulz


- turns out its still useful, despite falling out of favor for some while
- today we observe on four channels -> multimessenger astronomy with growing collaboration
- neutrinos fehlen hier noch komplett! -> entdeckung im nächsten Abschnitt ergänzen

\section{Multimessenger astronomy}

The sources of extraterrestrial radiation can be ...
(Vorgänge kurz anreißen, agns, supernovae...)
und key areas of research. func-ray scheint da einen guten Überblick zu haben. bookap auch, aer sehr lang


Nowadays we observe these processes by looking at one of four channels: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Electromagnetic radiation
	\item (Charged) cosmic rays
	\item $\nu$-radiation
	\item Gravitational waves
\end{enumerate}

All of these have vastly different properties and require different experiments.
In the recent years, it became a common thing to observe the same sources 
on different channels to learn more about the processes that happen at 
these far distant sources. This is what is often times 
referred to as multi messenger astronomy (cite some mma paper, eg magic looking at an icecube alert).

Before we focus on the special field of imaging air cherenkov telecopes, we will have
a brief look at the different channels.

		which requires the detectors to be of huge areas. Gravitational waves anyone?
	}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Charged cosmic rays}
The term charged cosmic rays summates all types of charged particles from
extra terrestrial sources with the main proportion seemingly neing protons
\cite{something something}


Cosmic rays can similarly be observed both directly and indirectly (werte falsch, anpassen).
- kurze erklärung davon


Figure \ref{fig:cr_spectrum} shows the flux of charged cosmic rays over 
many orders of magnitude in energy which mainly follows 
a power law $E^{-\gamma}$ with gamma somewhere between 
2.7 and 3.3. Deviations from this crude approximation are 
usually referred to as the first and second knee and the ankle 
at $5 10^{15}, 2 10^{17} and 5 10^{18}$ eV respectively.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/cr_spectrum.png}
	\label{fig:cr_spectrum}
	\caption{Combined plot of the cosmic ray spectrum, measured by different air shower experiments. \cite{pdg2019}. 
		The original data were taken from reports from \cite{Alfaro:2017cwx}, 
		\cite{1991ICRC....2...85F}, more here. or leave it altogether.
	}
\end{figure}


At the very highest energies, the flux seems to rapidly decrease, which may point towards a maximum energy
tat cosmological sources can produce or towards destructive interaction with 
the cosmic microwave background \cite{bookap}.

\subsection{Electromagnetic radiation}
In contrast to charged cosmic rays, $\gamma$-particles point towards
their sources, allowing to search for sources of radiation.
In astronomy electromagnetic radiation refers to $\gamma$-particles at all wavelength,
the term $\gamma$-radiation being assigned to the very highest energy particles.
The energy span is usually divided into different ranges, as can be seen in \ref{fig:em_spectrum}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/cr_spectrum.png}
	\caption{Search for another pic in a paper and cite properly}
	\label{fig:em_spectrum}
\end{figure}


Emitted photons can be observed either directly
from outside the atmosphere via satellites or indirectly
via ground based gamma astronomy. In the later case
IACT's are used to detect electromagnetic showers induced
by the collision of high energy photons with partticles in the atmosphere.
An example for direct observation could be the Fermi satellite (citation needed),
an example for ground based observation could be the
MAGIC-experiment (citation needed).

- smth bout the spectrum with image, bookap has smth but we might find a better one.

\subsection{Neutrinos}
Even less affected by interations on the way from the source to the earth are neutrinos.
Due to their small interaction cross sections and no electric charge, they 
suffer very little from absorption or deflection.
For very much the same reasons detecting neutrinos is much harder
than detecting photons or charged particles.

The small cross section requires to build huge detectors, 
the ICECUBE having a detector volume of \SI{1}{\kilo\meter^3}(cite that).

because of
their small cross-sections. This leads to thousands (größenordnung checken) of
neutrinos passing us continiusly without us even noticing.
For this reason neutrino detectors need to be very large. One example
of such a detector is the ICECUBE detector in ??? (ctation needed).

\subsection{Gravitational waves}
Gravitational waves are the newest channel available for observation.
We can detect them using large size interferometers such as
the LiGO's three detectors (citation needed).



Ground-based cherenkov astronomy focuses on either $\gamma$-rays or cosmic rays
