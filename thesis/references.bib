abstract = "First results concerning the performance characteristics of the HEGRA IACT array are given based on stereoscopic observations of the Crab Nebula with four telescopes. The system provides a γ-ray energy threshold around 0.5 TeV. The Crab signal demonstrates an angular resolution of about 0.1°. Shape cuts allow to suppress cosmic ray background by almost a factor 100, while maintaining 40% efficiency for γ-rays. The Crab signal is essentially background free. For longer observation times of order 100 h, the system in its present form provides sensitivity to point sources at a level of 3% of the Crab flux. Performance is expected to improve further with the inclusion of the fifth telescope and the implementation of advanced algorithms for shower reconstruction."

abstract="Considerable progress has been made in the last half-decade in the field of very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy (photons with energies between 1011 and 1013 eV). The high background level due to the isotropic cosmic ray flux which has bedevilled the field since its inception in the early 1960's can now be reduced to such a degree that significant gamma-ray signals from several sources become visible within a few hours of observation. The instrumentation and methodologies which have made this possible are reviewed. A brief historical introduction is followed by a summary of the salient properties of the atmospheric Cherenkov flash associated with VHE gamma-ray events. The major components of a VHE gamma-ray astronomy telescope are then reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of the different methodologies currently being used to discriminate against the cosmic ray background. Properties of several specific installations are then summarized, and possible future developments in VHE instrumentation are briefly discussed.",

abstract = "Most of what we know of cosmic gamma rays has come from spacecraft, but at energies above tens of GeV it has become possible to make observations with ground-based detectors of enormously greater collecting area. In recent years one such detector type, the cluster of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes, has reached a very productive state, whilst several alternative approaches have been explored, including converted solar power collectors and novel high-altitude particle shower detectors which promised to extend the energy range covered. Key examples of development from 1952 to 2011 are followed, noting the problems and discoveries that stimulated the current work, explaining the logic of the alternative approaches that were taken. The merits of the current major Cherenkov observatories and of other viable detectors are examined and compared, with examples of the astrophysical information they are beginning to provide. The detectors are still evolving, as we still do not understand the processes onto which the gamma rays provide a window. These include the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays (in particular, the wide-band spectra of radiation from some individual supernova remnants are still hard to interpret), the highly relativistic and variable jets from active galactic nuclei, and aspects of the electrodynamics of pulsars. Larger groups of Cherenkov telescopes still offer the possibility of an increase in power of the technique for resolvable Galactic sources especially."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",
